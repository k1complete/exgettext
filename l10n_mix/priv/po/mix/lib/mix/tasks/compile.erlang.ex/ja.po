"Compile Erlang source files.\n"
"\n"
"When this task runs, it will first check the modification times of\n"
"all files to be compiled and if they haven't been\n"
"changed since the last compilation, it will not compile\n"
"them. If any of them have changed, it compiles\n"
"everything.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, the task touches your `:compile_path`\n"
"directory and sets the modification time to the current\n"
"time and date at the end of each compilation. You can\n"
"force compilation regardless of modification times by passing\n"
"the `--force` option.\n"

"## Command line options\n"

"  * `--force` - forces compilation regardless of modification times\n"

"## Configuration\n"
"\n"
"  * `ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS` - can be used to give default compile options.\n"
"    The value must be a valid Erlang term. If the value is a list, it will\n"
"    be used as is. If it is not a list, it will be put into a list.\n"

"  * `:erlc_paths` - directories to find source files.\n"
"    Defaults to `[\"src\"]`.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:erlc_include_path` - directory for adding include files.\n"
"    Defaults to `\"include\"`.\n"
"\n"
"  * `:erlc_options` - compilation options that apply to Erlang's compiler.\n"
"    `:debug_info` is enabled by default.\n"
